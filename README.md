Restaurant Orders Python Script

This Python script demonstrates basic operations with lists, arrays, booleans, and dictionaries through a series of tasks related to managing restaurant orders and prices.

Overview

The script performs the following tasks:

Task 1: Basic List Operations

Define a list of orders (order).

Calculate the total sum of orders.

Find the maximum and minimum order values.

Calculate the average order value.

Print these statistics.

Task 2: Summary Output

Print a formatted summary of the total and average of the restaurant table orders.

Task 3: Boolean Condition Check

Define a threshold value.

Compare the threshold to the average order and maximum order values.

Output whether the condition (threshold > average AND max order > 700) is met.

Task 4: List Filtering and Appending

Define a list of prices.

Append a new price to the list.

Filter the list to only include prices less than 20,000.

Task 5: List Sorting

Sort the filtered list of prices in ascending order.

Task 6: Using Arrays

Convert the sorted price list to an array of integers.

Calculate and print the sum of the array elements.

Confirm the sum matches the original list sum.

Task 7: Dictionaries and List of Dictionaries

Create a list of client orders, each represented as a dictionary with id, name, and value.

Update the name of the first client.

Delete the last client from the list.

Calculate the total value of remaining client orders.

Print the dictionary list before and after modifications.
